# Swing
Explore the diverse capabilities of Java Swing for crafting dynamic and visually appealing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). From creating interactive buttons and menus to designing intricate layouts and implementing versatile components like sliders and progress bars. Dive into Swing's robust library of components and discover its flexibility in customizing appearance and behavior.

## Layered Pane
This example constructs a LayeredPane container comprising four distinct layers: a background, two animated clouds, and a calculator, each housed within its own panel. The graphical user interface (GUI) is depicted below, along with a draft of the class diagram for the current release.

## Drag and Drop
This example features an interface with a menu bar and a drawing panel. In the panel, users can draw, drag, and drop nodes, with connections automatically established between them. The app also provides functionality to save and load data, ensuring seamless project management. The graphical user interface (GUI) is depicted below, along with a draft of the class diagram for the current release. Notice, we are playing with a Blackboard/Singleton for academic purposes (a laboratory to be done).
